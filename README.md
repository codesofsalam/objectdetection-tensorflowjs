# Object Detection Site using React and TensorFlow.js

This project is an object detection site built using React and TensorFlow.js with the MobileNet model.

## Project Overview

This site utilizes TensorFlow.js to run object detection directly in the browser using the MobileNet model. The site is built with React and Vite, providing a fast and modern development setup.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codesofsalam/objectdetection-tensorflowjs.git
   cd objectdetection-tensorflowjs
   ```

2. **Create Vite:**
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
